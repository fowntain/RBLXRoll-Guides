## Blackjack
1. Pick any lobby that is not full.
> Whale tables are for betting 250 robux or more.
2. Click any seat. Click where it says `Take Seat` to claim it.
3. To bet, click the coin representing how much you want to bet. Then, click the spot on the table closest to your seat. It should look like a circle. That will place the bet.
> Bets are stackable. For example, if you place two bets of 25 robux value, it will total a 50 robux bet.
4. Once the round starts, you will receive two cards. There will also be a number showing you your total number. The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over.
- Hit: You will take another card. Its value will be added to your total amount. If you go over 21, you lose your bet.
- Stand: You will not take another card. You cannot hit again for the rest of the round. It is now the dealers turn, and if they get closer to 21, you lose your bet.
- Split: A split is offered when you draw two of the same card when the round starts. You will now have two hands on choosing this option. The game continues as normal, but you pick hit or stand for each hand you have.
- Double: A double allows you to double your bet if you have sufficient balance, and you draw one more card. If the card is over 21, you lose your total bet (including the double). You will not be able to hit again after choosing this.
5. Once the round is over, you will get 2X your bet if you win. If you happen to get blackjack (exactly 21), you will receive 2.5X your bet.
